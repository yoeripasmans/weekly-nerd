# Weekly Nerd
During my minor Web Development I attented different Workshops and lectures by companies and designers of the Frontend Development field. During these workshops and lectures I made several sketchnotes which can be found below.  I also wrote 5 articles about the techniques/themes discussed in the lectures and workshops.
